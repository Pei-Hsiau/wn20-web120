     <p>Web design has been elevated to new heights in recent years. There are now many ways that websites can display pictures and photos. One of them is called “gallery” feature.

However, it’s not just for the creative types; many other kind of sites, from restaurants to politics and everywhere in between, can all benefit from a modern image gallery. A CSS gallery allows a web designer to customize based on their client’s need, and the efficiency of the codes allows for the use of different types of showcase. Nevertheless, CSS galleries have advantages and downsides: while they excel due to simple code writing and efficient web compatibility, drawbacks include potential reductions in speed and responsiveness as features are added.
         
     <p>Many expect coding to be difficult, but CSS can actually be an easy way to create the image galleries. According to “CSS Image Gallery Examples That You Can Use on Your Site” by WpDataTables, “Setting up a CSS image gallery is quite simple,” even though galleries are more popular due to their speed, responsiveness, and overall aesthetics.’ For instance, the article highlights some very useful CSS galleries, such as CSS lightbox, a responsive and animated CSS-based library; Maximize, an overflow hidden responsive image gallery; CSS slider, a image gallery can be slide by using mouse hovering over; and Masonry gallery, another responsive and grid-functionality image gallery. Furthermore, some CSS gallery can be created with other coding system like JavaScript. For examples, written in “How TO - Tab Gallery” by W3school.com, “you can add html first before adding CSS style and JavaScript.</p>
 
     <p>Web browser compatibility is also important when the designer plan to create image galleries. According to W3school.com, “most CSS variables and elements are supported by most browsers.” Vendor prefixes helped developers use those new features and have them supported instantly without having to wait for each of them to become available for every browser. For examples, some browsers don’t fully support JavaScript, or the user’s computer or devices don’t have the accessibility to JavaScript. Where there’s advantages, there’s disadvantage Indeed. CSS gallery also has drawbacks, which designers should be aware of. They are effectiveness of speed and responsiveness.

Furthermore, the responding time is also the other effect of CSS gallery. When your client’s device is old, it will take more time to run these slideshows or pictures which made as CSS gallery.

     <p>In conclusion, Web designers not only can be benefited from a variety of choices from CSS galley, but also utilize coding in a simple way to create their client’s needs.
