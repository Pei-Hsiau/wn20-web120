<h2>Shopify vs Square</h2>
  <p>Online shopping has become the most influential shopping mode in nowadays society. According to Danielle Antosz from Digital.com writing in “E-COMMERCE SHOPPING CARTS: PICK ONE THAT’S BEST FOR YOUR BUSINESS”: “E-commerce is big business. Over 65% of retail sales occur online. With that market volume, it is no wonder so many businesses are moving to the industry.” If you are considering jumping on the e-commerce bandwagon, you’ve likely been looking at how to make that happen. At the core of each sale is shopping cart software. There are two shopping cart software that we’re introducing today, Shopify and Squared will be introduced separately; in order to understand their function and benefits. More, which one is better for user to use.
    
  <p>Shopify, a web-based shopping cart application, provides ready and set templates. Therefore, users can have a professional-looking store out of the box. Written in the article “E-COMMERCE SHOPPING CARTS: PICK ONE THAT’S BEST FOR YOUR BUSINESS”: “It is one of the leading cloud-based e-commerce software platforms that is designed for small, also medium-sized businesses. “Among the many online store builders that are available, Shopify ranks as one of the best that you can find. Developers can access HTML and CSS code to gain more control over their sites. They offer five plans, starting at just $9 per month and charge no transaction fees if you use Shopify Payments. Moreover, there are wide range of plans and templates that users can pick. The most important thing is that, Shopify offers SEO (Search Engine Optimization) to enable the site more visible in the market and easily to be found. However, with these functional offer, Shopify only has 14 days trail before users officially start to use the platform.</p>
    
  <p>On the other hand, Square offers free plan that user can save their penny with their own business. Furthermore, Square Online Store is a cloud-based (online) software. There is nothing to download or install.  Therefore, it’s very convenient to operate the system. Square not only is a better option if you’re low-volume merchants, but also is instrumental to be set up. Payments is easy to be operated, everyone can set up their own account and starts purchase and sell. However, the weakness is that Square Online Store is only available to merchants in the US and Canada. It also only supports orders that are made within the same country as the merchant.<p/>
  <p>To wrap up our Square vs. Shopify comparison, given everything we’ve covered, both of the shopping carts software has their own advantages and disadvantages. Still, the most essential thing is that what is users themselves target or goal for the online shopping? Whether to sell a small number of merchandising products, or a big scale of selling with larger amounts of products.
