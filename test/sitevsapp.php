<h2>Responsive Website vs. Mobile App. Which to choose?</h2>
<p>Nowadays, more than half of people use digital devices including smartphones and tablets to help them with daily life and to enjoy lots of entertainment. According to Arne Holst’s “Smartphone Users Worldwide 2020” chart: “In 2121, there will be predictably over 3.8 million smartphone users around the world(Statista)” However, the developers have been questioned about whether to create an entire full web page with mobile-orientated function, or instead develop a brand-new mobile app for their clients. These two things seem fairly similar in an individual point of view. Nevertheless, they are two very important, connected and still a bit different. Furthermore, both ways have their own pros and cons.

<p>First of all, website can be used to access with any browser by using HTML pages. In another way, “responsive” websites are specially designed to fit in a small device and screen, like mobile phones and tablets, with the help of CSS media queries. Most importantly, the users don’t need to download any additional application to use it. Also, written in “responsive website vs Mobile App: Comparison.” By Thinkmobiles,” responsive website will be more efficiently updated, supported and being fixed.” Moreover, it’s less time-consuming and cost-efficient to create responsive website. However, responsive website might be loaded some old browsers slowly since it is still a new technology.</p>
    
<p>On the other hand, Mobile apps require further installation and specially designed for mobile devices, including readability and speed. One of the advantages of mobile app is that some apps can work offline, which means users are able to use them even without any internet connection. Not only that, in the opinion of Kris in Smachstack, “Mobile Apps feature greater functionality than mobile-oriented sites can allow due to the way each is custom built into the device’s OS (Operate System). Although Mobile apps seems to be better- functioned, there are still some cons. Time-consuming and costly can be the biggest problem when developing a complete mobile app, there will be more set of skills required. Moreover, bugs on the mobile app can only be fixed and it takes a long time to recover and fix again.</p>

<p>In short, both alternatives have their advantages and disadvantages, which means that two of them are not better to each of them. Responsive website can be adjusted in any kind of devices, but the responding time takes longer; while mobile app can work offline but it’s difficult to fix completely. However, the most important thing is: who is your target client and how they will use them. </p>
