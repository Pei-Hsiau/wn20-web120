                    but need some more supports and help.These clients know more about usage of degital devices like tablet
                    and mobiles. On the other hand, another group of people might use more old-fashioned way to use technology by
                    using desktop. The age range can be around 20 to 60.

				   	Ages range from 50 to 65.
                    The clients in this category are knowledgeable but most are not saavy.  
				   	The site should be simple to navigate and use, getting this group of client to get information(ex.resume) immediately.
				   	They will probably only be using desktop. Furthemore, the design work page can be more specific and the text can be a little
                    bit bigger and readable for them (usually they use bigger screen), still not too big text.
                    They're the people who accpet more function-oriented website than design-oriented website.
